# The Myth of Endless Shopping - Research
## Aim and methodology of the research
### Purpose of the research
The aim of this research is to investigate whether it is possible, in a predetermined system - mainly a financial system - to continuously increase or maintain the standard of living of all indefinitely.
### Methodology
As part of the research I will write python scripts for the different models, run them and evaluate the results.
The scripts are each a cast in the economy.

#### Modells
This research focuses on two types of financial systems: Crypto-like and fiat-like. The former incorporates some crypto ideas and plans, such as DAO and trustless banking mechanisms. The fiat-like system incorporates structures used in the fiat world. For example, there is endless money printing.
##### Crypto-like
1. DAO Governance Voting: Simulate proposal creation and voting to test efficiency and fairness of decentralized decision-making.
2. Smart Contract Automation: Test simple and complex financial transactions executed via smart contracts for automation and reliability.
3. Token Supply Models: Experiment with fixed, inflationary, and deflationary token supplies to see effects on wealth distribution.
4. Decentralized Exchange Liquidity: Test liquidity provision/removal and its impact on price volatility and user experience.
5. Trustless Lending/Borrowing: Model peer-to-peer loans using smart contracts, examining default and collateral handling.
6. Sybil Attack Resistance: Simulate attacks with fake identities to test system robustness against manipulation.
7. Gas Fee Impact: Analyze how fluctuating transaction fees affect user participation and system scalability.
8. Blockchain Network Congestion: Simulate network overload and observe transaction delays and user frustration.
9. Randomized Block Rewards: Test how various reward mechanisms (lottery, pro-rata) affect miner/validator behavior.
10. On-chain vs. Off-chain Governance: Compare the effectiveness and transparency of on-chain vs. off-chain decision processes.
##### Fiat-like
1. Central Bank Money Printing: Model various rates of money creation to observe inflation and wealth dilution.
2. Fractional Reserve Banking: Test money supply growth and risk of bank runs under fractional reserve rules.
3. Interest Rate Policy: Simulate raising/lowering rates to see effects on loans, savings, and economic growth.
4. Government Bailouts: Test effects of corporate and bank bailouts on public trust and market stability.
5. Taxation Schemes: Model progressive, flat, and regressive tax systems and their effects on inequality.
6. Debt Accumulation & Defaults: Simulate household, corporate, or government debt cycles and the triggers for crisis.
7. Inflation Shocks: Introduce sudden inflation events and analyze impact on wages, prices, and living standards.
8. Unemployment Benefits: Test different welfare models for supporting citizens during recessions.
9. Currency Devaluation: Simulate effects of rapid currency depreciation on imports, exports, and living costs.
10. Banking System Trust Crisis: Model scenarios where public trust collapses and observe systemic reactions.
